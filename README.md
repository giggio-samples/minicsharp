# Mini .NET

This repo shows examples on how to build a small container with a .NET application.
The demos were presented at a talk in Portuguese. The details of the talk are
[here](https://bit.ly/rustfromscratch).

## Running

There is a Makefile at the root, there you will find what you need to run. This is
what you need to build and run everything.

````bash
make
````

At the end the images will be names `minicsharp:sometag`.
